        <h2>How prime sieves relate to Mertens' theorem</h2>
        <p>
            A trivial consequence of <u onclick="document.location='mertens-theorem-sieve-theory.html'">Mertens' Theorem</u> is:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
            \begin{equation}\tag{1}
                \pi (N) \sim \frac{e^{\gamma}}{2} N \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)
            \end{equation}
        </div>
        <p>
            and, as \(\frac{1}{2}e^{\gamma} &lt 1\) (\(\frac{1}{2}e^{\gamma}\approx 0.890522...\)), Mertens' Theorem implies:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
            \begin{equation}\tag{2}
                \pi (N) &lt N \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)
            \end{equation}
        </div>
        <p>
            in some sense as \(N\to\infty\). This contradicts intuition that \(\prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\) should somewhat accurately approximate \(\pi(N)\). Consider how the sieve of Eratosthenes removes multiples of \(2\), \(3\), \(5\) etc. up to \(\sqrt{N}\), leaving only primes below \(N\), as pictured below for \(N=120\):

        <p>
            One would expect \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the positive integers from \(1\) to \(120\) to not be divisible by \(2\), roughly \(\frac{2}{3}\) of these to also not be divisible by \(3\), about \(\frac{4}{5}\) of these to also not be divisible by \(5\), etc. From there, given that removing multiples of any primes below \(\sqrt{N}\) leaves almost all primes below \(N\) (which is true), one could expect to approximate \(\pi(N)\) as \(N\prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\). However, as per equations \(1\) and \(2\), this approximation significantly and proportionally overestimates \(\pi(N)\). <br> <br>

            To try to explain why the actual number of primes is lower than expected I'll be referring back to <u onclick="document.location='prime-sieves-infinite-descent.html'">this post</u> about a recursive property of the primes (sort of). But now to introduce some... idiosyncratic notation and terminology: let \(p\) always refer to a prime; let \(\lhd p\) be the prime before \(p\) and \(p\rhd\) be the prime after \(p\); then let the prime that is \(n\) primes before \(p\) be \(\lhd^n p\) (eg. \(\lhd^4 19 = 7\)) and let the prime \(n\) primes after \(p\) similarly be \(p\rhd^n\). Then, if a natural number \(n\) has no prime factors less than or equal to \(p\), let \(n\) be referred to as a '\(p\)-prime', and if \(p\) is the smallest prime factor of \(n\) then \(n\) is a '\(p\)-mine'. <br> <br>

            It follows that all \(p\)-mines are \(\lhd p\)-primes, and similarly all \(\lhd p\)-primes yield a \(p\)-mine when multiplied by \(p\). It's also obvious enough that

        <div class="formula">
            \begin{equation}\tag{3}
                N - \sum_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}(\text{number of }p\text{-mines}\leq N) = \pi(N) - \pi(\sqrt{N}) + 1
            \end{equation}
        </div>
        <p>
            since \(N - \sum_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}(\text{number of }p\text{-mines}\leq N)\) will give you the number of \(\sqrt{N}\rhd\)-primes less than or equal to \(N\). And the \(\sqrt{N}\rhd\)-primes less than or equal to \(N\) are all prime, except for the number \(1\), and only exclude primes less than or equal to \(\sqrt{N}\), hence equation \(3\). Then, by the less trivial Prime Number Theorem, \(\pi(N)-\pi(\sqrt{N})+1\sim \pi(N)\), so that
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
            \begin{equation}\tag{4}
                N - \sum_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}(\text{number of }p\text{-mines}\leq N) \sim \pi(N).
            \end{equation}
        </div>
        <p>
            So then equation \(2\) can be reframed as saying that the \(N\prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\) approximation for \(\pi(N)\) underestimates the total number of mines for \(p\leq \sqrt{N}\). Note that this approximation estimates the number of \(p\)-mines below \(N\) to be \(\frac{1}{p}\cdot N\prod_{k'=2}^{\lhd p}\left(1-\frac{1}{k}\right)\). The graph below shows \(p\) on the \(x\)-axis and the number of \(p\)-mines below \(10^9\) on the \(y\)-axis.
        </p>
        <img src="https://psychedelickoala.github.io/calvis-compendium/media/mines-10e9.jpg" style="width:90%;">
        <p>
            In the graph above, \(\frac{1}{p}\cdot N\prod_{k'=2}^{\lhd p}\left(1-\frac{1}{k}\right)\) visibly underestimates the number of \(p\)-mines below \(10^9\) for most \(p\) below \(\sqrt{10^9}\approx 31622.78\), in particular for \(1163 &lt p &lt 20207\) (read from graph). <br> <br>

            The recursive argument is as follows: as aforementioned, any \(\lhd p\)-prime multiplied by \(p\) will yield a \(p\)-prime; so to find all the \(p\)-mines below \(N\), multiply each \(\lhd p\)-prime less than or equal to \(\frac{N}{p}\) by \(p\). That is, the number of \(p\)-mines \(\leq N\) is equal to the number of \(\lhd p\)-primes \(\leq \frac{N}{p}\). Below is an animation illustrating this:

        </video>
        <p>
            It's also clear that the smallest \(\lhd p\)-primes are \(1\) and \(p\), as all natural numbers below \(p\) are divisible by some prime \(\leq \lhd p\). Consequently, the smallest \(p\)-mines are \(p\) and \(p^2\).
