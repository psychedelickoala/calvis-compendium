        <h2> Welcome to Calvi's Compendium! </h2>
        <p>
            Hello and welcome to my blog! I am a high school student with an interest in mathematics. Here I will primarily discuss elementary number theory,
            but might branch out into other topics like geometry and logic. <br> <br>
            
            For around a year I have been working on famous open problems such as Riemann's Hypothesis and the Twin Prime Conjecture. Many times I thought I'd solved one of them,
            only to find relatively obvious errors in my proofs shortly afterward. By now, I have accepted that these problems don't want to be solved using basic sieving 
            methods or high school algebra. Quite inconsiderate of them, really. :(<br><br>
            
            Harsh realities aside, the most important thing I learned was that there is more to mathematics than solving famous problems; ultimately, mathematical <em>problems</em> are 
            only a starting point for understanding the behaviour of mathematical <em>objects</em>, such as the zeta function or the prime numbers.
            In my experience, an ambitious focus on problem solving often resulted in my purposefully disregarding the many 'side quests' that presented themselves, 
            in favour of moving along with my proof. Consequently, I deprived myself of what could have been many fascinating pieces of mathematics. <br><br>
            
            That's what this blog is for: a compendium of side quests. My main goal is to build an understanding of primes, and prime sequences; and also maybe to branch out,
            and explore other topics. Perhaps I'll stumble across an original idea, or cultivate a unique perspective on some classic concept. Perhaps I'll achieve neither of these things. 
            If nothing else, I should become more fluent in \(\LaTeX\), and hopefully improve my mathematical writing. <br><br>
            
            True to form, the starting point for a significant proportion of this blog is an open problem in number theory: the prime k-tuple conjecture, which I have 
            defined <u>here</u>. You can also check out <u>link</u>, <u>link</u>, and <u>link</u>. Ciao!
