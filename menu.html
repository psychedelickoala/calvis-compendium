            <p>I use descent to represent a function analogous to the prime counting function as the sum of floored terms, then use Taylor and Fourier series to
            express it analytically.

            <p>I investigate the periodic, one-to-one nature of functions reliant on multiple modular congruencies. I then apply the findings
            to determine a lower bound for the functions &#964(N) and &#965(N) from my Mertens' Theorem post.</p>

            <p>I define Mertens' Theorem and explain how it contradicts intuition around prime sieves. I conjecture that its surprising effect
            accumulates over many infintessimal differences, presented as a hypothesis concerning a local function &#965(N). I then relate
            Mertens' theorem back to the prime k-tuple conjecture.</p>

            <a href="prime-k-tuple.html">What is the prime k-tuple conjecture?</a>
            <p>A definition of Hardy and Littlewood's prime k-tuple conjecture, which is a general case of the more famous Twin Prime Conjecture.
                The prime k-tuple conjecture was the motivation behind a lot of the mathematics on this blog.</p>
