        <h2> How overlapping modular functions behave </h2>
        <p>
            Let each natural number \(n\) be assigned a corresponding set \(M(n, p)\) such that \(M(n, p)=\{n\bmod{2}, n\bmod{3}, n\bmod{5}, ..., n\bmod{p}\}\) and \(p\) is a prime.
            For natural \(x\) and \(y\), \(M(x, p)=M(y, p)\) if and only if
            \begin{equation} \tag{1}
            x = y + z\cdot \prod_{k'=2}^{p} k
            \end{equation}
            where \(z\) is an integer. <br><br>

            For all \(k'\le p\), \(k\) divides \(z\cdot \prod_{k'=2}^{p} k\). It follows that if equation \(1\) holds for \(x\) and \(y\) then \(x\equiv y\bmod{k}\) for all \(k'\le p\),
            so that \(M(x, p)=M(y, p)\). The converse is that \(M(x, p)=M(y, p)\) implies equation \(1\) and we can prove this with <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>.
            Suppose there exist \(x, y\) where \(M(x, p)=M(y,p)\) but the difference between \(x\) and \(y\) is not \(z\cdot \prod_{k'=2}^{p} k\). Instead let the difference be \(d\).
            In general, if \(M(x, p)=M(y, p)\) then \(M(x+a, p)=M(y+a,p)\) given \(x+a\) and \(y+a\) are natural numbers. We define \(x&lt y\) so that \(y=x+d\) and
            \(M(x, p)=M(x+d, p)\) and we can add and subtract constants to show that for all natural \(n\), \(M(n, p)=M(n+d, p)\). This means that \(M(0, p)=M(d, p)\) which means that
            for all \(k'\le p\), \(d\bmod{k}=0\). But we have already stated that \(d\) cannot be expressed as \(z\cdot \prod_{k'=2}^{p} k\), so this is absurd. So we can conclude that
            there do not exist \(x, y\) satisfying \(M(x, p)=M(y, p)\) but not equation \(1\). <br><br>

            What this means is that for each prime \(p\), \(M(n, p)\) cycles as \(n\) increases and the period of those cycles is \(\prod_{k'=2}^{p} k\). Going back to the definition
            \(M(n, p)=\{n\bmod{2}, n\bmod{3}, n\bmod{5}, ..., n\bmod{p}\}\), we can see that the number of distinct possible such sets is \(2 \times 3 \times 5 \times ... \times p\),
            equal to the period of the cycle. Since each \(n\) in the cycle has a unique set \(M(n, p)\), every possible set can be attributed to exactly one \(n\) in the cycle. For example,
            if I choose \(p=7\), and two numbers with a difference of \(2\times 3\times 5\times 7=210\) such as \(57\) and \(267\), and a particular set \(M(n, p)\), like \(\{1, 0, 3, 6\}\), there
            will be one \(n\) between the two numbers with that corresponding set. In this case, \(n = 153\).<br><br>

            The general case of this is that for any set \(K\) of natural numbers \(\{k_1, k_2, k_3, ..., k_t\}\), the set \(M(n, K)\), defined as
            \(\{n\bmod{k_1}, n\bmod{k_2}, ..., n\bmod{k_t}\}\), is cyclic and the period is the greatest common divisor of all elements in \(K\). Then any function based on
            modular congruencies to \(k\) in \(K\) are similarly periodic. Such functions include \(\sum_{s=1}^{t} n\bmod{k_s}\) and \(\sum\sum_{s=1}^{t}\{\frac{n}{k_s}\}\) where
            \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\).
