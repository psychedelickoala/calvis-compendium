        <h2> The significance of Mertens' Theorem </h2>
        <p>
            Mertens' third theorem states that
            \[\lim_{N\to\infty}\ln{N}\prod_{p'=2}^{N}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)=e^{-\gamma},\]
            and by the Prime Number Theorem, the density of primes below \(N\), denoted \(d(N)\), has asymptotic behaviour
            \[d(N)\sim\frac{1}{\ln{N}};\]
            then by the transitive property, it is known that
            \[d(N)\sim e^{\gamma}\prod_{p'=2}^{N}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right).\]
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the natural numbers from \(1\) to \(N\) inclusive. 
            Removing all multiples of each prime \(p\) for which \(2 \le p\le \sqrt{N}\) leaves only primes remaining.
            Note that \(1\) is considered prime. Let \(R_p(N)\) return the ratio
            
            \[
                \frac{\mid\{ n \text{ s.t. } n\le N \land \forall k'\le p, k\not\mid n\}\mid}{\mid\{n\text{ s.t. } n\le N \land \forall k' &lt p, k\not\mid n\}\mid};
            \]
            
            then the product \(\prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}R_p(N)\) is less than \(d(N)\). This algorithm removes primes below \(\sqrt{N}\), as they are multiples of themselves,
            but leaves all other primes below \(N\). 
            Then the prime number theorem implies that \(\pi(\sqrt{N})=o(\pi(N))\), so that
            \[
                \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}} R_p(N) \sim d(N).
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems reasonable to estimate that as \(N\to\infty\), 
            \[
                \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}R_p(N)\sim \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right);
            \] 
            this is heuristically justified by the fact that for distinct primes \(k_1\) and \(k_2\),
            \(k_1\not\mid n\) and \(k_2\not\mid n\) are independent events with respective probabilities of approximately \(1-\frac{1}{k_1}\) and \(1-\frac{1}{k_2}\).
            The trivial corollary of Mertens' third theorem deduced below contradicts this:
            \[\lim_{N\to\infty}\ln{\sqrt{N}}\prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)=e^{-\gamma}\]
        </p>
        <p>
             \[\implies \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right) \sim \frac{e^{-\gamma}}{\ln{\sqrt{N}}}\]
        </p>
        <p>
             \[\implies \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right) \sim \frac{2e^{-\gamma}}{\ln{N}} \sim 2e^{-\gamma}d(N)\]
        </p>
        <p>
             \[\therefore d(N) \sim \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}} R_p(N) \sim \frac{e^{\gamma}}{2} \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right).\]
            It is worth noting that \(\frac{1}{2}e^{\gamma}\) is less than \(1\), being approximately \(0.890522...\); this implies that 
            \(\prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\) is an <em>overestimation</em> of the density of primes below \(N\).
        </p>
        <p>
            Let \(\tau\) and \(\upsilon\) be the greatest functions on \(N\) below \(\sqrt{N}\) that satisfy, respectively:
            \[
                \prod_{p'=2}^{\tau(N)}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\sim\prod_{p'=2}^{\tau(N)}R_p(N)
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
                \forall p'\le\upsilon(N), 1-\frac{1}{p} \sim R_p(N).
            \]
            While Mertens' theorem implies \(\tau(N) &lt \sqrt{N}\), it is still possible that \(\upsilon(N)=\sqrt{N}\). For example, suppose that for each \(p'\le\sqrt{N}\),
            \(R_p(N)\sim \exp\left({\frac{\gamma}{\pi(\sqrt{N})}}\right) \left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\). Then, since \(\exp\left({\frac{\gamma}{\pi(\sqrt{N})}}\right)\to 1\), \(1-\frac{1}{p} \sim R_p(N)\) for all \(p'\le\sqrt{N}\)
            and consequently \(\upsilon(N)=\sqrt{N}\). Note that if \(\upsilon(N)=\sqrt{N}\), then \(\tau(N)&lt\sqrt{N}-c\) for any positive constant \(c\).
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems likely that \(\upsilon(N)=\sqrt{N}\). I derive a lower bound \(b\) for both \(\tau\) and \(\upsilon\) <u onclick="document.location='modular-functions.html'">here</u>, the most significant properties
            of which are that \(b(N)\) diverges and \(b(N)=o(\sqrt{N})\). Consequently, for \(p'&gt b(N)\), \(1-\frac{1}{p}\to 1\); so if \(\upsilon(N)\neq\sqrt{N}\),
            then there must exist some unbounded function \(P(N)\) such that \(P(N\) is prime and \(R_{P(N)}(N)\) approaches some nonnegative number below \(1\).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Remark. </strong> My reasoning for imposing an upper bound of \(\sqrt{N}\) on \(\tau\) and \(\upsilon\) is as follows. Suppose \(\tau(N)\) and \(\upsilon(N)\) were not bounded from above by \(\sqrt{N}\). Then one might consider the case in which
            \(\tau(N):=N^{\exp(-\gamma)}\), as it implies:
            \[
                \prod_{p'=2}^{\tau(N)}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right) \sim \frac{\exp(-\gamma)}{\exp(-\gamma)\ln(N)} \sim \prod_{p'=2}^{\sqrt{N}}R_p(N);
            \]
            and since \(R_p(N) = 1\) for \(p &gt \sqrt{N}\), \(\tau(N):=N^{\exp(-\gamma)}\) satisfies \(\prod_{p'=2}^{\tau(N)}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\sim\prod_{p'=2}^{\tau(N)}R_p(N)\).

        <p id="generalForm">
            A more general form of Mertens' third theorem can be extrapolated using the identity:
            \[
                \prod_{p'&gt h}^{x}\left(1-\frac{h}{p}\right) \sim C \prod_{p'=2}^{x}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)^h,
            \]
            where \(C\) and \(h\) are constants. It follows that
            \[
                 \prod_{p'&gt h}^{x}\left(1-\frac{h}{p}\right) \sim \frac{C e^{-h\gamma}}{\left(\ln{x}\right)^h},
            \]
            which is relevant to the <u onclick="document.location='prime-k-tuple.html'">prime k-tuple conjecture</u>.
